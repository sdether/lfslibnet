LFSLib.NET
==========

LFSLib is a library for communicating the [Live For Speed]() Racing simulation using its [InSim](https://en.lfsmanual.net/wiki/LFS_Programming#InSim), [OutSim](https://en.lfsmanual.net/wiki/LFS_Programming#OutSim_.2F_OutGauge) and/or [OutGage](https://en.lfsmanual.net/wiki/LFS_Programming#OutSim_.2F_OutGauge) protocols. It has not been in active development since 2008. As such the code is based on deprecated C#/.NET versions and may not be compatible with the current state of the LFS protocols.
